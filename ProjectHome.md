## About the Toolkit ##
The Force.com Toolkit for Google Data APIs provides a free and open-source set of tools and services that developers can use to take advantage of Google Data APIs from within Force.com.

The goal of the toolkit is to make Google Data APIs – starting with Spreadsheets, Documents and Calendar – easy to use from within the Force.com environment.

The toolkit is modeled after the Java Client library for Google Data, with many of the same class and method names.  In some cases the names have been changed to fit with Apex Code naming conventions.

The Classes found here expose the Google APIs directly within Apex, making it easier to access them natively from Force.com apps and providing tighter integration between the platforms with less developer effort.

For a user not familiar with the Force.com platform, this cloud development platform provides a robust and trusted application development and delivery environment for businesses large and small.

## Apex Programers ##
For programmers of Apex Code, there is a wealth of reusable code and great examples of writing Test Methods to achieve high code coverage.

NOTE: this code uses the old method of parsing XML, a newer XML parsing method is provided directly by Apex, that should be used if you hit statement limits.

Share and Enjoy.
